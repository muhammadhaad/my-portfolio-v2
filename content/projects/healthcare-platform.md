# Healthcare Mobile Platform

This platform was designed to revolutionize healthcare access by providing patients with real-time access to their medical records and enabling easy appointment scheduling.

## Key Features

- Real-time medical record access
- Appointment scheduling and reminders
- Secure messaging with healthcare providers
- Prescription management
- Integration with hospital systems

The application was built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility and used WebSockets for real-time updates. Firebase was used for authentication and notifications, while MySQL handled the database requirements.
